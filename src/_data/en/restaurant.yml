p1: Located on the second floor of the iconic One Kearny building in downtown San Francisco, the West Coast restaurant opened
          its doors in November 2012 and is a stunning 10,000 sq ft space that accommodates up to 170 guests. Hakkasan San
          Francisco overlooks the bustling Market and Geary Streets, and benefits from natural light during the day and softly-lit
          hand-blown glass pendants at night, with an impressive bronze V-shaped bar as the restaurantâ€™s centre piece. Featuring
          two private dining rooms, the menu includes Hakkasan signature dishes as well as an extensive tea menu and innovative
          cocktails made with hand-pressed juices. Hakkasan San Francisco is open Monday-Saturday for lunch and dinner, with
          extended brunch hours on Saturdays.
p2: Our food is excellent, our wine list is thoughtful, our drinks are strong, and our service is unpretentious. A place for
          a cocktail, a glass of wine, or a fine meal. We look forward to serving you. Eat at Street.
